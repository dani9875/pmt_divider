# Photomultiplier tube resistor divider

A photomultiplier tube (PMT) resistor divider is a crucial component in the operation of photomultiplier tubes. These devices are highly sensitive light detectors used in various applications such as medical imaging, nuclear and particle physics, and scientific research.

The resistor divider network within a PMT is designed to ensure proper voltage distribution across the dynodes of the tube. Dynodes are the intermediate electrodes that amplify the signal produced by incident photons. The correct biasing of these dynodes is essential for optimal performance, signal amplification, and minimizing noise.

The typical resistor divider configuration involves a series of resistors connected between the high-voltage supply and ground. Each dynode is connected to a tap between two resistors, thereby establishing the necessary potential differences.
